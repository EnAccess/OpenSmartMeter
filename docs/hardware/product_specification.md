## **TITLE: PRODUCT AND SPECIFICATION MANUAL**

### **1. Introduction**
This is a meter with RS232 and wireless GSM communication using Cicada GSMmodule. It has various event alerting functions including kWh remote readingandlogging, using remote management and tampering provides customers a convenient
remote reading method, on the air top-up. This meter is favored by customers andmanufacturers with the features of high accuracy, wide measuring range andcompetitive cost performance. 

### **2. Tariff**
Tariff is software adjustable by energy provider as desired for meter. 

### **3. Communication**
Meter support RS232/2G/3G GSM, baud-rate: 115000. 

### **4. Measurement**
Meter measures voltage, current, active power and voltage is displayed on the 16x2LCD, accumulative power and top-up history is logged every 24 hours ontheweb-based software.

### **5. Mode**
Meter has 2 operation modes:

1. On the air top-up. 
2. STS token mode using keypad. 

#### **Over the air top-up**
Over the air top-up is done via the web-based software available, with meter tobetopped up pre-registered with a unique meter-id, the rest is handled betweenthesoftware and firmware to top-up the corresponding meter whose meter-id is enteredautomatically. 

#### **STS operation**
Enter 20-digit token via keypad available on meter, the token is generated fromthewebsite in event of network failure or malfunction.
